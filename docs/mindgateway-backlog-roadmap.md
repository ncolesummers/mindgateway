# MindGateway Hybrid Architecture - Product Backlog and Roadmap

## Product Vision
Build an enterprise-ready LLM inference gateway that eliminates firewall complexity through outbound-only connections while providing enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and scalability.

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- **Approach**: Hybrid architecture with extracted Auth and Worker Registry services
- **Core**: Modular monolith for gateway, routing, queuing, and business logic
- **Technology**: Go, gRPC for service communication, REST/WebSocket for clients
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-native with horizontal scaling capabilities
